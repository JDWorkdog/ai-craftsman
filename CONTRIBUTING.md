## Prompt Guidelines

When submitting prompts, please follow these guidelines:

### Structure
Each prompt should have its own folder under `prompts/{category}/` containing:
- `README.md` - What it does, when to use it, example outputs
- `claude.md` - Claude-optimized version
- `chatgpt.md` - ChatGPT-optimized version
- `gemini.md` - Gemini-optimized version

### Quality Standards
- **Tested** - Verify your prompt works across multiple scenarios
- **Clear** - Instructions should be unambiguous
- **Focused** - One prompt, one purpose
- **Documented** - Include usage examples and expected outputs

### LLM-Specific Adaptations
- **Claude**: Leverage its nuanced reasoning, can handle complexity
- **ChatGPT**: Be more explicit about output format, use examples
- **Gemini**: Include grounding context, be explicit about constraints

## Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and constructive
- Focus on the content, not the person
- Help others learn and improve
