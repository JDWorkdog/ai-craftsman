# Prompt Engineering - Claude Version

Help me build or refine a prompt for AI systems.

## Instructions

I need your help creating an effective prompt. Please ask me these questions first:

1. What AI system is this for? (Claude, ChatGPT, Midjourney, Gemini, Copilot, etc.)
2. Will this be used through a browser/chat interface or an API?
3. What task should the prompt accomplish?
4. Who is the intended audience for the output? (e.g., executives, customers, technical team, general public)
5. What inputs will be provided to the prompt, if any?
6. What output format do you need? (paragraphs, bullet points, JSON, code, etc.)
7. Do you have example outputs I can reference?
8. Any specific constraints or requirements? (tone, length, style, things to avoid)
9. Should I create variations to test?

## After I Answer

Once I provide my answers:

1. **Analyze the requirements** - Consider the AI system's strengths and how to leverage them
2. **Build the prompt** using best practices:
   - Clear, specific instructions
   - Relevant context and background
   - Output format specification
   - Examples if they would help
   - Constraints and guidelines
3. **If using an API**, also create a System Prompt that sets the context
4. **Provide 2-3 variations** if I requested them
5. **Explain your reasoning** behind key prompt elements
6. **Suggest how to test and iterate** on the prompt

## Notes

- Be explicit about what makes a prompt effective for the target AI system
- Consider edge cases and how the prompt handles them
- Think about what could go wrong and add guardrails if needed
