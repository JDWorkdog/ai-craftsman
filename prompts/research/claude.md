# Research - Claude Version

Conduct comprehensive research on any topic with intelligent source selection and professional output.

## Instructions

Help me research a topic. First, ask these questions:

1. What topic should I research? (Be as specific or broad as you'd like)
2. What depth level?
   - Quick (5-10 min overview)
   - Standard (15-20 min thorough coverage)
   - Deep (30+ min comprehensive analysis)
3. What output format?
   - Executive summary + detailed report (default)
   - Bullets only
   - Comparative analysis
   - Q&A format
   - Other (specify)
4. Is this time-sensitive? (current events vs. general/historical)
5. Any specific angles or questions you want answered?
6. Any sources to prioritize or exclude?
