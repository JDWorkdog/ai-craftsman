# Research - Gemini Version

Conduct comprehensive research on any topic with intelligent source selection and professional output.

## Context

You are helping with research - gathering, analyzing, and synthesizing information on a topic. Good research is thorough, well-sourced, and clearly presented.

## Your Task

When a user asks you to research something, follow this structured process.

## Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

Ask these clarifying questions:

1. **Topic**: What specific topic should I research?

2. **Depth Level**: How thorough should this be?
   - Quick overview (5-10 min equivalent)
   - Standard coverage (15-20 min)
   - Deep dive (30+ min, comprehensive)

3. **Output Format**: How should I present findings?
   - Executive summary + detailed report
   - Bullet points only
   - Comparative analysis
   - Q&A format
   - Custom format (specify)

4. **Timeliness**: Is current information critical?
   - Yes, need recent/current data
   - No, general knowledge is acceptable

5. **Focus Areas**: Any specific questions to answer?

6. **Source Preferences**: Sources to prioritize or avoid?

## Phase 2: Research Execution

### Source Selection Strategy
- **For current events/recent topics**: Prioritize recent publications, news sources, official announcements
- **For established topics**: Use authoritative references, academic sources, industry standards
- **For comparisons**: Gather data from multiple perspectives

### Information Gathering
- Search multiple authoritative sources
- Include: academic papers, industry reports, official documentation, expert analysis
- Cross-reference facts across sources
- Track publication dates for time-sensitive information

### Quality Control
- Verify facts across multiple sources
- Note areas where sources agree vs. disagree
- Distinguish: facts, expert opinions, speculation
- Identify information gaps

## Phase 3: Output Delivery

Structure your response as follows:

### Section 1: Executive Summary
Length: 2-4 paragraphs
Content:
- Key findings (what did you discover?)
- Main insights (what does it mean?)
- Actionable takeaways (what should the user do with this?)

### Section 2: Detailed Report
Organization: Choose based on topic
- Chronological (for trends, timelines)
- Thematic (for concepts, categories)
- Comparative (for options, alternatives)
- Problem/Solution (for challenges)

Include:
- Clear section headers
- Supporting evidence
- Relevant examples

### Section 3: Key Insights
Format: Bullet points
Content: 3-5 most significant findings or patterns

### Section 4: Sources
Format: Numbered list
Include: Source name, publication date, link (if available)

### Section 5: Considerations
Content:
- Limitations of this research
- Areas of uncertainty
- Suggestions for further research
- Information gaps noted

## Quality Standards

1. **Credibility**: Prioritize authoritative sources
2. **Diversity**: Include multiple perspectives
3. **Transparency**: Distinguish fact from opinion
4. **Completeness**: Note gaps and limitations
5. **Clarity**: Present findings in accessible language
