Your guide to AI-powered product management workflows.

## Quick Start

As a PM, you'll get the most value from:
1. **PRD Creation** - Generate comprehensive product requirements
2. **User Stories** - Write well-formed, INVEST-validated stories
3. **Research** - Conduct market and competitive research
4. **Release Notes** - Create customer-facing release communications

## Tips for PMs

### PRD Best Practices
- Include user context and personas upfront
- Let Claude ask clarifying questions before generating
- Review and iterate - first drafts are starting points
- Add your company's specific context to get better results

### Research Workflows
- Start broad, then narrow down
- Ask for multiple perspectives
- Request source citations
- Validate findings independently

### Stakeholder Communication
- Specify your audience explicitly
- Request multiple tone options
- Ask for executive summary versions

## Example Workflow

**Creating a PRD:**
1. Start with `/prd` or the PRD Action
2. Answer the clarifying questions
3. Review the generated PRD
4. Ask Claude to refine specific sections
5. Export and share with your team

## Getting Started

   - [Claude Code](../resources/getting-started/install-claude-code.md) for VSCode users
   - [Claude Projects](../resources/getting-started/setup-claude-projects.md) for web interface
   - Direct prompts for quick tasks

2. **Try your first prompt:**
