Help me draft a professional email.

**IMPORTANT: Format questions clearly - each question MUST be on its own numbered line. DO NOT combine questions into a paragraph.**

Ask me:
1. Who is the recipient? (role/relationship)
2. What is the purpose of this email?
3. What tone should I use? (formal, casual, friendly, direct)
4. What key points must be included?
5. Is there a call-to-action needed?
6. Any context I should know?

Then draft the email with:
- Compelling subject line (provide 2-3 options)
- Proper greeting
- Clear, concise body
- Appropriate closing
- Professional signature placeholder

Provide the email in plain text format, ready to copy and paste.
