Conduct comprehensive research on any topic with intelligent source selection and professional output.

**IMPORTANT: Format questions clearly - each question MUST be on its own numbered line. DO NOT combine questions into a paragraph.**

Ask me:
1. What topic should I research? (Be as specific or broad as you'd like)
2. What depth level? (quick = 5-10 min, standard = 15-20 min, deep = 30+ min)
3. What output format? (default: executive summary + detailed report, or specify: bullets only, comparative analysis, Q&A format, etc.)
4. Is this time-sensitive? (current events, recent data, or general/historical topic)
5. Any specific angles or questions you want answered?
6. Any sources to prioritize or exclude?

Then:
- **Determine research approach**: Use web search for current events, recent developments, emerging topics, or anything post-2024. Use knowledge base for historical, conceptual, or established topics.
- **Gather information**: Search across multiple high-quality sources (academic papers, industry reports, authoritative news, expert blogs, official documentation)
- **Verify and cross-reference**: Check facts across multiple sources, note areas of consensus vs. debate
- **Organize intelligently**: Structure based on topic nature (chronological for trends, thematic for concepts, comparative for alternatives, etc.)
- **Create output**:
  - **Executive Summary**: 2-4 paragraphs with key findings, main insights, and actionable takeaways
  - **Detailed Report**: Organized sections with depth appropriate to research level
  - **Sources**: Properly cited with links (for web research) or references (for knowledge-based research)
  - **Key Insights**: Highlight most significant findings or emerging patterns
  - **Considerations**: Note limitations, areas of uncertainty, or topics needing further research
- **Save output**: Store in `output/research/` with descriptive dated filename (e.g., `2025-01-15_ai-agent-frameworks_research.md`)
- **Provide summary**: Give me a brief overview of what you found and where you saved it

**Research Quality Standards**:
- Prioritize authoritative, credible sources
- Include diverse perspectives when appropriate
- Distinguish between facts, expert opinions, and speculation
- Note publication dates for time-sensitive information
- Highlight gaps in available information
