Help me brainstorm ideas on a topic.

**IMPORTANT: Format questions clearly - each question MUST be on its own numbered line. DO NOT combine questions into a paragraph.**

Ask me:
1. What topic or problem are we brainstorming about?
2. What's the goal or desired outcome?
3. Any constraints or parameters to consider?
4. How many ideas would you like?
5. Any specific frameworks or approaches to use? (e.g., SCAMPER, Six Thinking Hats, First Principles)

Then:
- Generate diverse, creative ideas
- Organize ideas by category or theme
- Rate each idea briefly on feasibility and impact
- Highlight the top 3 most promising ideas
- Suggest next steps for the best ideas
- Save the brainstorm session to `output/brainstorms/YYYY-MM-DD_[topic]_brainstorm.md`
