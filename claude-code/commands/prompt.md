Help me build or refine a prompt for AI systems.

**IMPORTANT: Format questions clearly - each question MUST be on its own numbered line. DO NOT combine questions into a paragraph.**

Ask me:
1. What AI system is this for? (Claude, ChatGPT, Midjourney, etc.)
2. Will this be through the browser or an API?
3. What task should the prompt accomplish?
4. Who is the intended audience? (e.g., executives, customers, technical team, general public)
5. What inputs will be included, if any?
6. What output format do you need?
7. Will you include example outputs?
8. Any specific constraints or requirements?
9. Should I create variations to test?

Then:
- Analyze the requirements
- If using an API, also include a System Prompt
- Build a well-structured prompt using best practices:
  - Clear instructions
  - Relevant context
  - Output format specification
  - Examples if helpful
  - Constraints and guidelines
- Provide 2-3 variations if requested
- Explain the reasoning behind key prompt elements
- Suggest how to test and iterate on the prompt
